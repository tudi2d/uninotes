# A Gatsby Starter for making notes on different subjects
-----------------------------------

An example site can be found [here](https://gatsby-starter-notes.netlify.com/).

This Gatsby template is a simple, static site for displaying your notes written in markdown is a visually readable way. It also acts as a form of management over your notes. 

To add new subjects just create a directory called `subject_name` under the `pages` directory and then for each new topics within the subject you can create a folder with that name and an `index.md` with the notes for that topic. 

To run in development: `gatsby develop`
