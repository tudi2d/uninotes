## about

My name is Philipp, I study computer science at the RWTH Aachen and these are my personal notes for some of my university lectures. They are not meant to be perfect nor complete. Most of the notes are just summarizing the slides of the lecture in a short, personal way, which helps me to recall the lecture. The notes are in the language of the lecture, which means that the majority is in german and some are in english.

If you have any question regarding this website feel free to send me an e-mail.
