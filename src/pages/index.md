## about

This web app is intended to easily create and share notes for university classes. It is possible to write notes using Markdown language as well as including inline LaTeX, which is transpiled to HTML KaTeX.

My name is Philipp, I study computer science at the RWTH Aachen and these are my personal notes from some of my university lectures. They are not meant to be perfect nor complete. Most of the notes are just summarizing the slides of the lecture in a short, personal way, which helps me to recall the lecture. The notes are in the language of the lecture, which means that the majority is in german and some are in english.
